	Abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past ~50 years, reaching pandemic levels. Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies - both at the individual and population level - have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies.},

The Compendium coding scheme links a five-digit code that describes physical activities by major headings (e.g., occupation, transportation, etc.) and specific activities within each major heading with its intensity, defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate (MET). Energy expenditure in MET-minutes, MET-hours, kcal, or kcal per kilogram body weight can be estimated for specific activities by type or MET intensity. Additions to the Compendium were obtained from studies describing daily PA patterns of adults and studies measuring the energy cost of specific physical activities in field settings. The updated version includes two new major headings of volunteer and religious activities, extends the number of specific activities from 477 to 605, and provides updated MET intensity levels for selected activities.},

This committee selected 15 other workshop discussants on the basis of their research expertise in issues related to the health implications of physical activity. Several relevant professional or scientific organizations and federal agencies also were represented.Evidence.—The panel of experts reviewed the pertinent physiological, epidemiologic, and clinical evidence, including primary research articles and recent review articles.Consensus Process.—Major issues related to physical activity and health were outlined, and selected members of the expert panel drafted sections of the paper from this outline. A draft manuscript was prepared by the planning committee and circulated to the full panel in advance of the 2-day workshop. During the workshop, each section of the manuscript was reviewed by the expert panel. Primary attention was given to achieving group consensus concerning the recommended types and amounts of physical activity. A concise "public health message" was developed to express the recommendations of the panel. During the ensuing months, the consensus statement was further reviewed and revised and was formally endorsed by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine.Conclusion.—Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week.(JAMA. 1995;273:402-407)}",

	abstract = {Deep Learning adalah sebuah bidang keilmuan baru dalam bidang Machine Learning yang akhir-akhir ini berkembang karena perkembangan teknologi GPU accelaration. Deep Learning memiliki kemampuan yang sangat baik dalam visi komputer. Salah satunya adalah pada kasus klasifikasi objek pada citra. Dengan mengimplementasikan salah satu metode machine learning yang dapat digunakan untuk klasifikasi citra objek yaitu CNN. Metode CNN terdiri dari dua tahap. Tahap pertama adalah klasifikasi citra menggunakan feedforward. Tahap kedua merupakan tahap pembelajaran dengan metode backpropagation. Sebelum dilakukan klasifikasi, terlebih dahulu dilakukan praproses dengan metode wrapping dan cropping untuk memfokuskan objek yang akan diklasifikasi. Selanjutnya dilakukan training menggunakan metode feedforward dan backpropagation. Terakhir adalah tahap klasifikasi menggunakan metode feedforward dengan bobot dan bias yang diperbarui. Hasil uji coba dari klasifikasi citra objek dengan tingkat confusion yang berbeda pada basis data Caltech 101 menghasilkan rata-rata nilai akurasi mencapai. Sehingga dapat disimpulkan bahwa metode CNN yang digunakan pada Tugas Akhir ini mampu melakukan klasifikasi dengan baik.},

abstract ={Purpose: This study aimed to compare the effects of fatigue due to overground and treadmill running on the plantar pressure distribution pattern.   Methods: Twelve novice athletes (Mean&plusmn;SD age=26.0&plusmn;2.5 y, Mean&plusmn;SD weight: 52.0&plusmn;3.0 kg, Mean&plusmn;SD height: 159.0&plusmn;5.0 cm), without sports injuries over the past year, were selected. Overground and treadmill running created fatigue in the samples. Peak plantar pressure distribution, Center of Pressure, contact area, and impulse the samples were recorded using a footscan (Footscan Version 7 Gait 2nd generation software) pressure system during running before and after the fatigue protocol and analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS v. 18.   Results: Peak plantar pressure on the second to fifth toe , the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones, and medial part of the heel significantly increased. The shift in the Center of Pressure of the foot was non-significant in all stages. The contact area at the second metatarsal and midfoot area shifted only before the fatigue protocol on overground running. Impulse at the second to fifth toe, first to fifth metatarsal, significantly increased in the ground running.   Conclusion: The results showed that fatigue due to treadmill running has different effects compared to fatigue due to overground running. },
